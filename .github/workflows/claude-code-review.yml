            You are performing a SECURITY-FOCUSED code review for a Flask-based household expense tracker.
            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on the codebase architecture and conventions.

            ## Security Checklist - Review ALL changes for:

            ### Authentication & Authorization
            - Password handling (hashing, storage, strength requirements)
            - Session security (HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies)
            - Login/logout flow vulnerabilities
            - Authorization checks on all protected routes (@login_required, @household_required)

            ### Data Protection
            - **CRITICAL**: Household data isolation - ALL database queries MUST filter by household_id
            - Sensitive data exposure in responses, logs, or error messages
            - PII handling compliance

            ### Injection Attacks
            - SQL injection (must use parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM)
            - XSS (template escaping, user input rendering in Jinja2)
            - Command injection
            - CSRF protection on all forms (Flask-WTF tokens)

            ### Input Validation
            - User input sanitization
            - File upload security (if applicable)
            - API parameter validation

            ### Security Headers & Configuration
            - HTTPS enforcement
            - Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS)
            - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
            - Secret/credential exposure in code (no hardcoded keys, tokens, passwords)

            ## Output Format
            Structure your review as:

            ### Security Review Summary
            - Overall assessment (PASS/CONCERNS FOUND)
            - Number of issues by severity

            ### Issues Found (if any)
            For each issue:
            - **Severity**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
            - **File**: `filename:line_number`
            - **Issue**: Description of the vulnerability
            - **Remediation**: Specific fix recommendation

            ### Positive Security Practices (optional)
            Note any good security patterns observed in the changes.
