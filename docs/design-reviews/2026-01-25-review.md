## Screenshot 1: Login Screen

**File:** `screenshot-❌-1769381700352-(design-review).png`

### What's Working Well

**Level 1: Experience & Flow**
- Clean, focused login experience with no distractions
- Clear value proposition ("Track household expenses together") immediately visible
- Logical flow: branding → form → primary action → secondary action
- "Forgot Password?" link appropriately placed near password field
- Sign up link clearly distinguished at bottom for new users

**Level 2: Visual Hierarchy**
- Strong brand presence with cat icon and app name at top
- Terracotta (#D97B4A) brand color consistently applied to icon, active field border, CTA button, and links
- Form card has appropriate elevation/contrast against dark background
- Primary "Log In" button has excellent visual weight and prominence

**Level 3: Pixel-Level Precision**
- Cat icon renders perfectly with clean lines
- Icon alignment within form fields appears consistent
- Typography hierarchy is clear: large title, smaller tagline, form labels

### Issues Found

**Issue:** Red asterisks on "Email *" and "Password *" labels may have insufficient contrast
**Location:** Form labels, above input fields
**Why It Matters:** Users may miss required field indicators, leading to form submission errors
**Fix:** Use terracotta brand color (#D97B4A) instead of red, or increase asterisk size
**Severity:** medium

**Issue:** Inconsistent icon styles - cat icon in email field vs. lock icon in password field
**Location:** Form field icons
**Why It Matters:** Visual inconsistency undermines brand cohesion
**Fix:** Use consistent icon style - either both cat-themed or both standard
**Severity:** medium

**Issue:** Form field icons may be too small
**Location:** Left side of each input field
**Why It Matters:** Icons may not be immediately recognizable
**Fix:** Increase icon size to 20-24px (IconSize.md or IconSize.lg)
**Severity:** low

## Screenshot 2: Transactions List (UI Redesign Test)

**File:** `screenshot-❌-1769362873176-(ui-redesign-test).png`

### What's Working Well

**Level 1: Experience & Flow**
- Clean, scannable list with consistent row structure
- Month navigation with left/right arrows is intuitive
- Bottom tab bar provides clear navigation options
- Search icon in top left provides easy access to filtering
- Profile/settings icon in top right is standard iOS pattern

**Level 2: Visual Hierarchy**
- Transaction rows have good visual separation with circular icon containers
- Amount values are prominent on the right
- Secondary information (category, date, payer) is appropriately de-emphasized in smaller gray text
- Active tab (Transactions) is highlighted in terracotta

**Level 3: Pixel-Level Precision**
- Tab bar icons are consistent in size and style
- Transaction row icons all use the same circular container with terracotta background
- Left alignment of all text elements within rows is consistent

### Issues Found

**Issue:** All transaction rows use identical icon (shopping bag) for different categories
**Location:** Transaction list, left side of each row
**Why It Matters:** Users can't quickly scan and identify transaction types visually
**Fix:** Implement category-specific icons:
- Groceries → shopping bag (current) ✓
- Transportation → car/transit icon
- Entertainment → ticket/popcorn icon
- Utilities → lightning bolt/house icon
- Subscriptions → TV/streaming icon
**Severity:** high

**Issue:** "Paid by Alice" and "Paid by Bob" text has very low contrast
**Location:** Third line of each transaction row
**Why It Matters:** May fail WCAG AA contrast requirements, hard to read
**Fix:** Use darker gray - recommend warm600 (#57534E) or darker
**Severity:** medium

**Issue:** Month navigation arrows may be too small for touch targets
**Location:** Top of screen, left and right arrows around "January 2026"
**Why It Matters:** iOS HIG recommends 44x44pt minimum touch targets
**Fix:** Verify touch area is ≥44pt or add larger transparent touch areas
**Severity:** medium

**Issue:** Last transaction row cut off at bottom
**Location:** Bottom of transaction list, last visible row
**Why It Matters:** Users may not realize there's more content
**Fix:** Add adequate padding above tab bar (Spacing.lg or Spacing.xl)
**Severity:** low

## Screenshot 3: Transactions List (Logout View)

**File:** `screenshot-❌-1769362979854-(logout).png`

### What's Working Well

**Level 1: Experience & Flow**
- Consistent layout with previous transactions view
- Different transactions shown demonstrate the app handling diverse expense types
- Tab bar navigation remains consistent

**Level 2: Visual Hierarchy**
- Same strong hierarchy as Screenshot 2
- Transaction amounts are easily scannable
- Category and payer information appropriately secondary

**Level 3: Pixel-Level Precision**
- Consistent icon container sizes across all rows
- Alignment maintained across different transaction types

### Issues Found

**Issue:** Icons still not matching categories - most use shopping bag icon
**Location:** Transaction list, left side of each row
**Why It Matters:** Same critical usability issue as Screenshot 2
**Fix:** Implement proper icon-to-category mapping (see Screenshot 2 fix)
**Severity:** high

**Issue:** Same low contrast issue on "Paid by Alice/Bob" text
**Location:** Third line of each transaction row
**Why It Matters:** Accessibility concern
**Fix:** Use warm600 (#57534E) or darker
**Severity:** medium

## Cross-Screen Consistency Analysis

### What's Working Well
- **Brand identity is strong and consistent**: Terracotta (#D97B4A) used consistently across login (icon, button, links) and transactions (active tab, icon backgrounds)
- **Tab bar navigation is identical** across both transaction views
- **Typography hierarchy is consistent** across all screens
- **Cat icon theme is present** in both login and transaction list contexts

### Issues Found

**Issue:** Dark mode login vs. light mode transactions creates jarring transition
**Location:** Cross-screen experience
**Why It Matters:** Disrupts visual continuity and brand experience
**Fix:** Standardize on light mode throughout (recommended) OR implement full dark mode support
**Severity:** high

**Issue:** Icon style inconsistency between login and transaction screens
**Location:** Login form icons vs. transaction row icons
**Why It Matters:** Undermines design system cohesion
**Fix:** Use circular terracotta containers throughout (including login form)
**Severity:** medium

## Summary

- **Screenshots reviewed:** 3
- **Strengths identified:** 12
- **Issues found:**
  - High: 3
  - Medium: 5
  - Low: 3
- **Brand alignment:** Needs work (dark/light mode inconsistency)

## Priority Fixes

1. **Fix category icon mapping** — Implement proper icon-to-category logic. Use car for transportation, scissors for personal care, lightning for utilities, TV for subscriptions.

2. **Standardize light mode across entire app** — Convert login screen from dark mode to light mode with cream background for cohesive experience.

3. **Increase contrast on secondary text** — "Paid by" text needs darker gray. Target warm600 (#57534E) for WCAG AA compliance.

## Patterns to Preserve

- Strong terracotta brand color usage throughout
- Circular icon containers in transaction rows
- Clean typography hierarchy with rounded fonts
- Consistent tab bar navigation
- Month navigation pattern with chevrons
